# CommentRetrieval
# Abstract

Websites take full advantage of Web 2.0 technologies to increase user engagement. One of the most effective tools for reader engagement is commenting, where users are allowed to post their views as comments for items published at these websites. News websites, in particular, have been quick to embrace commenting technologies. 

Most websites employ third party commenting systems to create and manage their comment sections. One can crawl the comments by sending URL requests to those commenting system servers. In this project, we propose an approach to retrieve user comments by instantiating URL templates supported by these web servers.
