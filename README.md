# CommentRetrieval
# Abstract

Most websites employ third party commenting systems to create and manage their comment sections. One can crawl the comments by sending URL requests to those commenting system servers. In this project, we propose an approach to retrieve user comments by instantiating URL templates supported by these web servers.
We conduct extensive experiments over 8,000 web pages to show the effectiveness of our solution.

# Get Started

Code and datasets will be uploaded soon once our submission is accepted.
